SimpleRPG
---------------

I start this as test project to show that the creation of games by using the Zend Framework (+jQuery, +X) is possible.
And furthermore very easy.
Later this game will go on-line and remains open-source, so the users can submit gameplay changes to the live-server.

You may [flattr me] if the project shows first "greater" results ;)
